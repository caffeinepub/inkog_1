  "summary": "REQ-11 documentation update appears to be implemented in frontend/README.md (per diff summary). The backend diff snippet does not show any logic that bootstraps the first admin when zero admins exist, so REQ-10 cannot be confirmed and appears missing based on available evidence. Additionally, an unrelated project_state.json update appears in the diff without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Implement admin bootstrapping so that when the canister has zero admins configured, the first authenticated caller who triggers the admin check is automatically granted admin privileges (and any required base user permission); thereafter, non-admins remain denied unless explicitly granted.",
      "reason": "In the provided backend/main.mo diff excerpt, all admin-gated methods simply check AccessControl.isAdmin(...) and trap on failure; there is no visible conditional path that detects \"zero admins\" and grants admin to the first authenticated principal. No evidence of calling an admin-granting function or mutating accessControlState to add the caller as admin is shown.",
